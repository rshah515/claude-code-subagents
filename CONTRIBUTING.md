## üìù Agent Development Guidelines

### Agent Format
Every agent MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description of expertise and when to invoke
tools: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3
---

You are a [role] specializing in [expertise].

## Expertise Section

### Subtopic
[Explanation with working code examples]

## Best Practices
1. **Practice Name** - Description
[7-10 key practices]

## Integration with Other Agents
- **With agent-name**: How they collaborate
```

### Quality Standards
- **Code Examples**: Must be practical and runnable
- **Modern Practices**: Use latest stable versions
- **Completeness**: Cover all major aspects of the domain
- **Integration**: Reference relevant agents for collaboration
- **Length**: 400-600 lines of comprehensive content

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `framework-expert.md`
- Be specific but concise: `react-expert.md` not `react-framework-specialist.md`
- Group by category: Place in appropriate directory
