### Potential Future Expansions
- Creative agents (graphic-designer, video-content-creator) - currently skipped per user request
- Platform specialists (salesforce, sap, sharepoint, servicenow) - currently skipped per user request
- More industry verticals (manufacturing, media, retail, logistics) - currently skipped per user request
- API specialists (rest-api, event-driven)
- Frontend specialists (micro-frontend, design-system, state-management, css-architecture)

## Integration Guidelines

1. **Correct References**: When agents reference each other, use actual agent names from our collection
2. **Bidirectional**: If agent A references agent B, agent B should reference agent A where appropriate
3. **Generic References**: Keep "backend/frontend developers" generic as they map to language experts based on project
4. **Collaboration Patterns**: 
   - Architects design â†’ Developers implement â†’ Testers verify
   - Incident occurs â†’ Commander coordinates â†’ Specialists fix
   - PRD defines â†’ Architect designs â†’ Team builds

## Code Standards

1. **Working Examples**: All code must be practical and runnable
2. **Modern Practices**: Use latest stable versions and modern patterns
3. **Comments**: Minimal comments - code should be self-documenting
4. **Error Handling**: Show proper error handling in examples
5. **Security**: Never include hardcoded secrets or vulnerable patterns
6. **Performance**: Demonstrate efficient implementations

## Building Priority

1. High Priority: Data & AI agents, Database specialists
2. Medium Priority: Remaining infrastructure, frameworks, quality
3. Lower Priority: Additional languages, specialized domains

## Agent Workflow Optimization

### Routing Instructions for Claude Code

To ensure optimal agent selection and workflow coordination:

1. **Project-Level Requests** should trigger `prd-writer` first:
   - "Build a [feature/system/application]"
   - "Implement [complex functionality]" 
   - "Create a solution for [business need]"
   - Any request affecting multiple components or lasting >1 week

2. **Follow PRD-First Workflow** for complex projects:
   ```
   prd-writer â†’ project-manager â†’ architect â†’ implementation agents â†’ testing â†’ deployment
   ```

3. **Direct Agent Selection** for simple tasks:
   - Bug fixes â†’ debugger â†’ language expert
   - Code improvements â†’ refactorer â†’ language expert  
   - Infrastructure tasks â†’ cloud-architect/devops-engineer
   - Documentation â†’ technical-writer

4. **Agent Descriptions** have been updated to clarify:
   - **prd-writer**: PRIMARY AGENT for project planning
   - **project-manager**: WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATOR  
   - **architect**: TECHNICAL DESIGN SPECIALIST (works FROM requirements)

### Workflow Documents

- `WORKFLOW_CONFIG.md`: Detailed routing rules and configuration
- `WORKFLOWS.md`: Comprehensive workflow patterns for different project types

## Important Notes

- Each agent should be 400-600 lines focusing on depth of expertise
- Include both conceptual knowledge and practical implementation
- Show real-world scenarios and solutions
- Ensure agents complement rather than duplicate each other
- Test that integration points make sense
- **Follow the optimal workflow patterns** for better coordination
- **Update README.md after completing each category of agents**

## README Update Process

After completing each category of agents:
1. Update the README.md file with the newly created agents
2. Include brief descriptions of each agent's capabilities
3. Update the progress count
4. Ensure the README accurately reflects the current state of the project
