- **Usability Testing**: Validating assumptions with users

```typescript
// User Interview Script Structure
interface UserInterview {
  warmup: {
    background: string[];
    context: string[];
  };
  problemDiscovery: {
    currentProcess: string[];
    painPoints: string[];
    workarounds: string[];
  };
  solutionValidation: {
    mockupFeedback: string[];
    featurePrioritization: string[];
    willingnessToPay: string[];
  };
}

// Example JTBD Framework
const jobsToBeDone = {
  functionalJob: "Track marketing campaign performance",
  emotionalJob: "Feel confident in marketing decisions",
  socialJob: "Impress stakeholders with insights",
  constraints: ["Limited technical skills", "Budget < $500/mo"]
};
```

### Product Requirements & Specifications

- **Release Planning**: Phased rollout strategies

```yaml
# Epic: Real-time Collaboration
## User Story: Document Co-editing
As a: Team member
I want to: Edit documents simultaneously with colleagues
So that: We can collaborate without version conflicts

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Multiple users see real-time cursor positions
- [ ] Changes sync within 100ms
- [ ] Conflict resolution handles simultaneous edits
- [ ] Presence indicators show active users
- [ ] Offline changes sync when reconnected

### Technical Requirements:
- WebSocket connection for real-time sync
- Operational Transform algorithm
- Redis for session management
- PostgreSQL for document storage
```

### Roadmap & Prioritization
- **OKR Planning**: Objectives and key results alignment
- **Feature Prioritization**: RICE, Value vs Effort matrices
- **Dependency Management**: Technical and resource constraints
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Balancing competing priorities
- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating risks

```python
# RICE Prioritization Framework
def calculate_rice_score(reach, impact, confidence, effort):
    """
    reach: users affected per quarter
    impact: 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal
    confidence: 100%=high, 80%=medium, 50%=low
    effort: person-months
    """
    return (reach * impact * confidence) / effort

features = [
    {
        "name": "AI-powered insights",
        "reach": 5000,
        "impact": 3,
        "confidence": 0.8,
        "effort": 3,
        "score": calculate_rice_score(5000, 3, 0.8, 3)  # 4000
    },
    {
        "name": "Mobile app",
        "reach": 2000,
        "impact": 2,
        "confidence": 0.5,
        "effort": 6,
        "score": calculate_rice_score(2000, 2, 0.5, 6)  # 333
    }
]
```

### Analytics & Metrics
- **Product Analytics**: User behavior and engagement
- **A/B Testing**: Experimentation framework
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion optimization
- **Cohort Analysis**: Retention and churn patterns
- **North Star Metric**: Single metric focus

```sql
-- Weekly Active Users (WAU) Calculation
WITH user_activity AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('week', activity_date) as week,
    COUNT(DISTINCT activity_date) as days_active
  FROM user_events
  WHERE activity_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
  week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as wau,
  AVG(days_active) as avg_days_per_week,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN days_active >= 3 THEN user_id END) as power_users
FROM user_activity
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week DESC;

-- Feature Adoption Funnel
SELECT 
  'Viewed Feature' as stage,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users,
  100.0 as conversion_rate
FROM events WHERE event_name = 'feature_viewed'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'Started Setup' as stage,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users,
  100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) / 
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM events WHERE event_name = 'feature_viewed') as conversion_rate
FROM events WHERE event_name = 'setup_started'
-- Continue for each funnel stage
```

### Stakeholder Management
- **Executive Communication**: Board decks and updates
- **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Engineering, design, sales
- **Customer Advisory Boards**: Direct user feedback loops
- **Internal Enablement**: Training sales and support teams

```

### Definition Phase
1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Stakeholder interviews
   - Technical feasibility
   - Design constraints

2. **Specification Writing**
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Data models and APIs
   - Non-functional requirements

### Development Phase
- Sprint planning and backlog grooming
- Daily standups and blocker removal
- Mid-sprint check-ins and adjustments
- Sprint reviews and retrospectives

### Launch Phase
- Beta testing and feedback collection
- Launch preparation and rollout plan
- Internal enablement and training
- External communication and marketing
- Success metrics monitoring

## Best Practices

1. **Customer Obsession** - Start with the customer and work backwards
2. **Data-Driven Decisions** - Use metrics and experimentation to validate assumptions
3. **Fail Fast** - Build MVPs and iterate based on learning
4. **Cross-Functional Partnership** - Collaborate closely with engineering and design
5. **Clear Communication** - Over-communicate priorities and rationale
6. **Continuous Discovery** - Regular user research and feedback loops
7. **Strategic Thinking** - Balance short-term wins with long-term vision
8. **Prioritization Discipline** - Say no to maintain focus
9. **Outcome Focus** - Measure success by user outcomes, not feature delivery
10. **Growth Mindset** - Learn from failures and iterate quickly
